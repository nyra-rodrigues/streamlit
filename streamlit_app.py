üìå **Insight:**  
- **Guest users spend ~44% less time on the platform** than registered users.  
- This suggests **friction in engagement**, possibly due to:
  - **Lack of onboarding**
  - **No incentive to register**
  - **Users passively browsing rather than interacting**
- **Most sessions end after UI rendering,** instead of meaningful actions like **form submissions or button clicks.**  
- **To improve engagement:**  
  - Improve **onboarding for guest users.**  
  - Add **incentives for registration.**  
  - **Encourage deeper interactions** (e.g., personalized recommendations, call-to-action prompts).

st.write("""
**Insight:**  
- A large portion of users **drop off within the first 30 seconds of their session**.  
- This suggests that users **aren‚Äôt finding value quickly enough** or **are leaving due to UI/UX friction**.  
- **Short session lengths indicate low engagement**, meaning users may be:
  - **Not finding what they need immediately**.
  - **Facing an unintuitive interface**.
  - **Losing interest before interacting with key features**.

**How to Improve Engagement:**  
- Optimize **onboarding experience** to guide users toward valuable actions.  
- Ensure **important content is visible immediately**‚Äîreduce friction in navigation.  
- Add **clear calls to action (CTAs)** to encourage further engagement (e.g., "Try Feature X Now!").  
- **Analyze high drop-off pages** to identify problem areas and improve UI/UX.

**Insight:**  
- **Peak engagement occurs around 8 PM**, when most events are recorded.  
- However, **users are primarily browsing (widget:render, view events)** rather than interacting deeply.  
- **Secondary activity peaks** exist in the late afternoon, but engagement drops significantly after 9 PM.

**How to Improve Engagement During Peak Hours:**  
- Implement **calls to action (CTAs) during peak times** to convert passive browsing into meaningful actions.  
- Optimize **platform performance** to handle increased load at **8 PM**.  
- Introduce **real-time engagement features (e.g., notifications, prompts, or personalized recommendations)** to encourage deeper interactions.

- **Monday to Thursday see consistently high engagement**, indicating strong usage during the workweek.  
- **Weekend activity drops significantly**, especially on **Saturday (lowest engagement day)**, suggesting that users primarily interact with the platform for **work-related tasks**.

**How to Optimize Engagement Based on This Insight:**  
- **Schedule important updates, campaigns, and releases on Tuesdays** to maximize visibility and interaction.  
- **Prioritize workweek engagement strategies**, focusing on Monday-Thursday for key user interactions.  
- **Reconsider weekend-focused efforts**, as engagement is significantly lower, especially on Saturdays.

**Insight:**  
- **Late-night and early-morning session spikes (4 AM, 10-11 PM) suggest passive or automated activity.**  
- **Morning users (6 AM - 10 AM) engage for structured work tasks but don‚Äôt stay logged in for extended periods.**  
- **Afternoon sessions (12 PM - 4 PM) are shorter, indicating task-based interactions rather than prolonged engagement.**  
- **Evening sessions (6 PM - 8 PM) show a dip, reinforcing the platform‚Äôs work-centric nature.**  
- The **late-night increase** could be due to **either night-owl users or automated non-human activity (batch processes, data retrieval, etc.).**  

**How to Optimize Session Management:**  
- **Investigate whether long late-night sessions are real engagement or passive activity.**  
- **Introduce session timeouts or idle detection** to improve platform efficiency.

**Insight:**  
- **Short sessions are dominated by UI rendering & navigation**, with users checking dashboards but not engaging deeply.  
- **Long sessions (3+ hours) also lack strong interaction events**, meaning users are either:
  - **Leaving tabs open without active usage**  
  - **Navigating inefficiently to complete tasks**  
  - **Reviewing data without making edits, updates, or transactions**  
- **Few users engage in meaningful actions (e.g., form submissions, data entry, transactions), regardless of session length.**  

**How to Improve Engagement:**  
- **Introduce engagement nudges** (e.g., ‚ÄúNeed help finding something?‚Äù).  
- **Optimize workflows** to reduce unnecessary navigation and improve task efficiency.  
- **Detect idle sessions** and prompt users with **actionable next steps (e.g., "Complete your task now")**.  
- **Analyze long-session behaviors** to determine if they are real engagement or passive/automated activity.

- Many users **significantly reduced their activity in 2025**, indicating lower retention.

- Drop-offs may be related to **workflow inefficiencies, frustration with session experiences, or changing business needs**.

**How to Improve Retention:**  
- **Investigate session performance issues** to reduce potential UX bottlenecks.  
- **Track user frustration signals (e.g., increasing session_end usage)** as early warnings of disengagement.  
- **Engage at-risk users before they drop off**, using proactive outreach, recommendations, or UI nudges.  
- **Improve onboarding & user education**, especially for those switching business units.

**Insight:**  
- Time spent is generally **low and stable** until **a massive spike around Day 26**.  
- Smaller fluctuations around **Days 14-16** suggest periodic bursts of engagement.  
- The **spike at Day 26** is likely an **outlier or an external trigger (e.g., event, update, or bot activity).**  

**Possible Causes:**  
- Users **spend limited time daily** but occasionally **engage deeply** on certain days.  
- The **Day 26 spike may be due to abnormal session durations, automated scripts, or a one-time event.**  

**Next Steps to Improve Engagement:**  
- Investigate **why engagement spiked at Day 26** (real user activity vs. technical artifact).  
- Encourage **consistent engagement patterns** rather than one-time deep usage.  
- Use **interactive features** (recommendations, tasks, notifications) to sustain user interaction.

- A **large portion of users return** (orange bars), but there is also a significant number of **one-time users (blue bars).**  
- A **few users return at extremely high frequencies**, while most return occasionally.  
- **Wide variation in return rates** suggests different user segments:  
  - **Highly engaged users** (frequent returns).  
  - **Casual users** (occasional returns).  
  - **One-time visitors** (do not return).  

**Possible Causes:**  
- Some users may be **exploring the platform briefly before dropping off.**  
- Frequent returners may be **power users, admins, or users with complex workflows.**  
- Non-returners may have **faced usability issues or not found enough value.**  

**Next Steps to Improve Retention:**  
- Identify **top returners** and analyze their behaviors to **replicate their engagement patterns**.  
- Investigate why **one-time users drop off** (feedback surveys, exit interviews).  
- Offer **personalized re-engagement strategies** (reminders, tutorials, targeted content) to casual users.

**Insight:**  
- **Return rate remains high early on (~95-100%) but drops significantly around Day 20.**  
- A **steep decline between Days 20-23** suggests many users disengage at this point.  
- The **spike at the end** suggests a possible **data anomaly** or a sudden event that brought users back.  

**Possible Causes:**  
- Users may **complete their primary tasks within the first 20 days**, leading to lower return rates after.  
- **Lack of engagement triggers (e.g., reminders, follow-ups)** may cause users to drop off.  
- A **sudden return spike** could indicate **a campaign, update, or forced login event.**  

**Next Steps to Improve Stickiness:**  
- Implement **re-engagement strategies** around **Days 15-20** (emails, notifications, reminders).  
- Analyze what **caused the return spike at the end** to replicate that effect.  
- Encourage **long-term usage patterns** by introducing **continuous engagement features**.
